Android Blueprint
=================

This project is based on Clean Architecture and has three
main modules: data, core (domain), and application.

The main features of the Android Blueprint project include:

- Three modules (data, core, application) based on Clean Architecture principles
- Room database for data persistence
- Repository pattern in the data module
- Business logic contained in UseCase classes in the core module
- Remapping of modules in the core module for scalability and maintainability
- User interface in the application module for user interaction

The data module is responsible for handling data persistence using the Room database. The repository
pattern is used to abstract the data layer and provide a single source of truth for the rest of the
application.

The core module contains all of the business logic in the form of UseCase classes. These classes
handle the processing of data and execution of actions based on the requirements of the application.

Finally, the application module is responsible for tying everything together and providing a user
interface for the user to interact with. It communicates with the core module to execute the
necessary business logic and updates the UI as needed.

Remapping of modules is done in the core module to ensure that the separation of concerns is
maintained and the application is scalable and maintainable.
